        "    -> Python is a high-level interpreted programming languages know for its easy to read syntax and versatility.\n",
        "    Python is popular because Simple and readable syntax, versatile, Huge libraries and frameworks, big community support, works on all operating system without change and Integrates easily.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interperter in Python?\n",
        "    -> In python, an interperter is a program that reads and executes your python code line by libne, instead of compiling that whole code into machine language first.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are per-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "    -> pre-defined keywords in python are reserved words that have special meaning in language. These words are part of python syntex and cannot be used as variable names, functions or identifiers.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "    -> No keywords cannot be used as variable names. Since keywords have special meaning in python syntax which may results you in syntax error.\\\n",
        "  \n",
        "5. What is mutability in python?\n",
        "    -> Mutibility in python means the object can be changed from on state to other after it is craeted.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are list mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "    -> Lists are ment to store a collection of items that may change can add or remove item or modify elements.\n",
        "    Tuples are ment to be fixed collection of items, often used to group data that shouldn't be changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between \"==\" and \"is\" operators in python?\n",
        "    -> Difference between \"==\" and \"is\" operators in python are:\n",
        "    \"==\" Equality operator:\n",
        "    * \"==\" Checks two values are equal and their contents are same\n",
        "    * \"==\" Compares values.\n",

        "\n",

        "    -> Converting data from one form to another is called type casting in python. Pythons have a built in functions for type casting.\n",
        "    Ex: converting string into integer.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is á¹­he difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "    -> Difference between implict and explicit type casting is:\n",
        "     * Implicit type casting - In python automatically converts one data type to another with any user intervention, usually from smaller to larger or general type to avoid data loss.\n",
        "     * Explicit type casting - User manually converts data into one form to another using built-in functions such as int(), str(), float().\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in python?\n",
        "    -> The purpose of conditional statement in python is to contral the flow of program based on contitions, they allow code to make decisions by its own.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does elif statement works?\n",
        "    -> Python checks the condition from top to bottom. As soon as finds the condition is true, it will execute that block and will skip rest all the blocks. In program can have multipe elif blocks but will execute only one block.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.  What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "    -> Difference between for loop and while loop is:\n",
        "    For Loop:\n",
        "    * the for loop is used to iterate over a sequence or to repeate code set number of times.\n",
        "    * It runs a fixed number of iterations based on a sequence or range.\n",
        "    * It can be used when you know in advance how many times want to repeat a block of code.\n",
        "\n",
        "    while loop:\n",
        "    * While loop is used to repeat the code as long as conditions is true.\n",
        "    * It will run the code block as long as contions evalates to true. If condition never becomes false it may leads to infinity loop.\n",
        "    * It can be used when the number of iterations is not known, and want to run the loop until the condition is met.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe the scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n",
        "    -> The scenario where a while loop is more suitable than for loop is real time applications or games, where you don't know how long to run but it should continue until the certain conditions like win/lose need to be met. In  such case while loop is usefull.\n",
